# NumPy Treasure Hunt: A Middle School Adventure with Arrays

## Welcome to the Treasure Hunt!

In this activity, you'll learn about NumPy arrays while 
searching for hidden treasures. NumPy is a powerful tool used 
by data scientists and AI developers to work with data!

Let's start by importing NumPy and setting up our game:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from IPython.display import clear_output
import time
import random
```

## Part 1: Creating Your Treasure Map

First, let's create a treasure map using a NumPy array. Each 
number on our map represents different terrain:
- 0: Empty space
- 1: Forest
- 2: Mountains
- 3: Desert
- 4: Lakes
- 9: Hidden Treasure!

```python
# Create a 6x6 treasure map
treasure_map = np.array([
    [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3],
    [1, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3],
    [0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 2],
    [0, 4, 4, 0, 2, 2],
    [3, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 0]
])

# Let's hide 3 treasures in random locations
treasures = 3
for _ in range(treasures):
    x, y = random.randint(0, 5), random.randint(0, 5)
    treasure_map[x, y] = 9  # 9 represents treasure
    
print("Treasure Map Created! The treasures are hidden 
somewhere on this map...")
```

## Part 2: Visualizing Your Map

Let's visualize our treasure map! This will show what the 
terrain looks like, but the treasures will be hidden:

```python
def display_map(map_array, reveal_treasures=False):
    """Display the treasure map with colors for different 
terrain"""
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    
    # Create a copy of the map for display
    display_map = map_array.copy()
    
    # Hide treasures unless specified
    if not reveal_treasures:
        display_map = np.where(display_map == 9, 
np.random.choice([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]), display_map)
    
    # Set colors for different terrain
    cmap = plt.cm.colors.ListedColormap(['lightgrey', 
'darkgreen', 'brown', 'yellow', 'blue', 'red'])
    bounds = [-0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 9.5]
    norm = plt.cm.colors.BoundaryNorm(bounds, cmap.N)
    
    # Create the heatmap
    plt.imshow(display_map, cmap=cmap, norm=norm)
    
    # Add grid lines
    plt.grid(True, color='black', linestyle='-', 
linewidth=1.5)
    
    # Add row and column indices
    plt.xticks(range(map_array.shape[1]), 
range(map_array.shape[1]))
    plt.yticks(range(map_array.shape[0]), 
range(map_array.shape[0]))
    
    # Add labels
    terrain_types = ['Empty', 'Forest', 'Mountains', 
'Desert', 'Lakes']
    if reveal_treasures:
        terrain_types.append('Treasure!')
        handles = [plt.Rectangle((0,0), 1, 1, color=c) 
                 for c in ['lightgrey', 'darkgreen', 'brown', 
'yellow', 'blue', 'red']]
    else:
        handles = [plt.Rectangle((0,0), 1, 1, color=c) 
                  for c in ['lightgrey', 'darkgreen', 
'brown', 'yellow', 'blue']]
    
    plt.legend(handles, terrain_types, loc='upper left', 
bbox_to_anchor=(1, 1))
    
    plt.title("Treasure Map")
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

# Display the map without revealing treasures
display_map(treasure_map)
```

## Part 3: Learning NumPy Indexing to Find Treasures

Now let's learn how to use NumPy array indexing to search for 
treasures!

```python
def check_location(x, y):
    """Check if there's a treasure at the given 
coordinates"""
    if x < 0 or x >= treasure_map.shape[0] or y < 0 or y >= 
treasure_map.shape[1]:
        print("Oops! Those coordinates are outside the map. 
Try again!")
        return False
    
    if treasure_map[x, y] == 9:
        print("ðŸŽ‰ CONGRATULATIONS! You found a treasure! ðŸŽ‰")
        return True
    else:
        terrain = ["an empty space", "a forest", "mountains", 
"a desert", "a lake"][treasure_map[x, y]]
        print(f"You searched at coordinates ({x}, {y}) and 
found {terrain}. Keep looking!")
        return False
```

# Challenge 1: Find Your First Treasure

Let's try to find a treasure by searching at specific 
coordinates! In NumPy, we access elements in a 2D array using 
the syntax: `array[row, column]`

```python
# Try searching at coordinates (2, 3)
print("Let's search at coordinates (2, 3):")
found = check_location(2, 3)
```

# Challenge 2: Explore Using Slices

In NumPy, you can select entire rows, columns, or sections 
using slices. Let's explore a row to see what's there:

```python
# Let's look at the entire 3rd row (index 2)
print("\nExploring the entire 3rd row (index 2):")
print(f"Row 2 contains: {treasure_map[2, :]}")

# What terrain types are in this row?
for i, terrain in enumerate(treasure_map[2, :]):
    terrain_name = ["an empty space", "a forest", 
"mountains", "a desert", "a lake", "unknown", "unknown", 
"unknown", "unknown", "a treasure!"][int(terrain)]
    print(f"Position (2, {i}) has {terrain_name}")
```

# Challenge 3: Using Conditions to Find Treasures

NumPy allows us to use conditions to find elements in an 
array. Let's try to narrow down where the treasures might be:

```python
# Let's find all desert locations (value 3) - treasures might 
be hidden in the desert!
print("\nLooking for desert locations...")
desert_locations = np.where(treasure_map == 3)

print(f"Desert locations found at coordinates:")
for i in range(len(desert_locations[0])):
    print(f"({desert_locations[0][i]}, 
{desert_locations[1][i]})")

# Let's check if any of these desert locations contain 
treasure
print("\nLet's check one of these desert locations for 
treasure:")
if len(desert_locations[0]) > 0:
    # Check the first desert location
    x, y = desert_locations[0][0], desert_locations[1][0]
    found = check_location(x, y)
```

# Challenge 4: Find All Treasures

Now it's your turn to find all the treasures! You can use any 
of the techniques we've learned:
1. Check specific coordinates
2. Explore rows or columns using slices
3. Look for patterns or specific terrain types

```python
# Your code here to search for treasures
# For example:
# found = check_location(1, 4)  # Check if there's treasure 
at (1, 4)
# print(treasure_map[3, :])     # Look at the entire 4th row
```

# Reveal the Treasures

Once you think you've found all the treasures (or if you're 
stuck), you can reveal their locations:

```python
print("\nRevealing all treasure locations:")
display_map(treasure_map, reveal_treasures=True)

treasure_locations = np.where(treasure_map == 9)
print("Treasures were hidden at:")
for i in range(len(treasure_locations[0])):
    print(f"({treasure_locations[0][i]}, 
{treasure_locations[1][i]})")
```

## Part 4: Advanced Treasure Hunt Challenges

Now that you've mastered the basics, try these advanced 
challenges!

```python
# Let's create a larger, more complex treasure map
large_map = np.random.choice([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], size=(10, 10))

# Hide 5 treasures
for _ in range(5):
    x, y = random.randint(0, 9), random.randint(0, 9)
    large_map[x, y] = 9

print("New Advanced Treasure Map Created!")
display_map(large_map)

# Challenge 1: Find treasures in the top-right quadrant
print("\nChallenge: Find treasures in the top-right quadrant 
(rows 0-4, columns 5-9)")
top_right = large_map[0:5, 5:10]
treasure_count = np.sum(top_right == 9)
print(f"There are {treasure_count} treasures in the top-right 
quadrant")

# Challenge 2: Find treasures in even-indexed rows
even_rows = large_map[::2, :]  # Select rows 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
treasure_count = np.sum(even_rows == 9)
print(f"There are {treasure_count} treasures in even-indexed 
rows")

# Challenge 3: Find treasures along the diagonal
diagonal = np.diag(large_map)
treasure_count = np.sum(diagonal == 9)
print(f"There are {treasure_count} treasures along the main 
diagonal")

# Final reveal
print("\nRevealing all treasure locations on the advanced 
map:")
display_map(large_map, reveal_treasures=True)
```

## Part 5: Create Your Own Treasure Hunt!

Now it's your turn to create a treasure hunt for a friend! 
Define your own map, hide treasures, and write clues using 
NumPy techniques:

```python
# Create your own map
my_map = np.zeros((8, 8))

# Add different terrains
# For example: mountains along the top edge
my_map[0, :] = 2

# Add forests on the left side
my_map[:, 0] = 1

# Add a lake in the middle
my_map[3:5, 3:5] = 4

# Add some desert
my_map[5:8, 5:8] = 3

# Hide your treasures
# Example: my_map[1, 6] = 9

# Display your map
print("My Custom Treasure Map:")
display_map(my_map)

# Write a clue for your friend
print("Clue: Look along the edge of the forest, where it 
meets the mountains...")
```

Congratulations on completing the NumPy Treasure Hunt! You've 
learned about:
1. Creating and visualizing NumPy arrays
2. Accessing elements using indexing and slicing
3. Using conditions to find specific values
4. Working with more advanced array operations
